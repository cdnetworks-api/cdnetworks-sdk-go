# Cdnetworks SDK for Go

This README provides documentation for using the Cdnetworks SDK for Go.

## SDK Installation(Recommended)

```bash
go get github.com/cdnetworks-api/cdnetworks-sdk-go
```

## Product Single Installation

```bash
go get github.com/cdnetworks-api/cdnetworks-sdk-go/cdnetworks/usage
```

## Example Usage

The SDK uses AKSK (Access Key/Secret Key) authentication. Configure your credentials as follows:

```go
package main

import (
    "github.com/cdnetworks-api/cdnetworks-sdk-go/common/auth"
    "github.com/cdnetworks-api/cdnetworks-sdk-go/cdnetworks/usage"
    "log"
)

func main() {
	// Refer to the API list at the end of this document and modify the corresponding {ActionName}, Method, and Uri
    request := &usage.{ActionName}Request{}

    // Configure authentication
    var config auth.AkskConfig
    config.AccessKey = "YOUR_ACCESS_KEY"
    config.SecretKey = "YOUR_SECRET_KEY"
    config.Uri = "/your/api/path"
    config.Method = "HTTP_METHOD"  // GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.

    // Create response object and make API call
    response := usage.{ActionName}Response{}
    _, err := auth.Invoke(config, request, response)

    // Handle response
    if err != nil {
        log.Printf("error: %s\n", err)
        return
    }

    log.Printf("response body: %s\n", response.String())
}
```

## Error Handling

Always check for errors returned by the API calls:

```go
_, err := auth.Invoke(config, request, response)
if err != nil {
    log.Printf("error: %s\n", err)
    // Handle the error appropriately
    return
}
```

## API List
For detailed API documentation and available methods, please refer to the [official Cdnetworks API documentation](https://docs.cdnetworks.com/en/cdn/apidocs).

| ActionName | enDescription | client_methods | uri |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Getdomainusage | This interface is used to query the traffic data of a specified domain name in the East 9th District. The user needs to provide the query time range, domain name and contract information. The returned result contains the usage data of the domain name corresponding to each timestamp. It helps users monitor domain name traffic, perform resource planning and cost management. | POST | /api/domain-usage |
| Getcontractusage | This interface is used to query the usage data of a single contract in the East 9th District. The user needs to provide the contract ID and query time range to obtain the data. The returned result includes the usage data of each time slice of the contract within the specified time period, in bytes. It helps users monitor the data usage under the contract, so as to perform cost management and resource planning. | POST | /api/contract-usage |
| Getpeakusage | Get peak usage of contract and domain under the contract, all data of Local Storage is supported in GMT+9 | POST | /api/peak-usage |
